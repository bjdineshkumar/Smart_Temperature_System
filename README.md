# Smart_Temperature_System

The Smart temperature monitoring system was created as part of IoT course by Bolt IoT. 

Description:
  The System is designed to monitor temperature in a cooling chamber using Bolt IoT module. The difference between normal tempearture system and the system we have proposed is, we will be using Z-score algorithm to detect anomalies in the temperature by constantly monitoring the chamber. We can detect if the chamber door has been opened or closed based on the anomaly. The system is also capable of sending an email whenever someone opened or when the temperature varies from the optimal temperature we have determined. More about the system is explained in the ppt attached to the repo.
